# Blog Admin
This is the content management system for Blog.

Featured articles are a selected amount of articles by website owners. To streamline this effort, simply send a post request to 'api/cache-featured-articles/'. The cms will automatically fetch and cache recent updates from selected RSS feeds.

## Deployment
